My time is now mostly spent learning vanillaJS (particularly functional programming), and on how culture and teams are impacted by intrinsic motivation.\r\n\r\nMy technology career started at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I studied the theories and principles behind algorithms and data structures, and gained a larger respect and understanding for the history of computers and the large-scale patterns surfaced through informatics. While studying in Boulder, I was exposed to the startup ecosystem within that area, pursuing clubs, workshops, and internships that deepened my curiosity and drive to be a digital maker in the 21st century. I won CU's New Venture Challenge (NVC) with some friends my sophomore year at CU Boulder with the early prototype of what is now a successful travel business called Pana (pana.com); that summer I interned at Waffle.io, a project management tool built on top of GitHub issues, working with real customers to generate and develop on ideas and new features that made it into production at the end of summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nI then attended the Turing School in Denver, where I learned the application of technology, how to build for the web, and how to write clean, modular code. Along the way, I have come to appreciate the value of conversation and collaboration. I foster a desire to learn and help others understand potentially complex concepts, and feel that constant communication, psychological safety, and iterative improvements are some of the most vital things that people can do to facilitate contribution and growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, I have put a considerable amount of time and effort into asking myself how I can use technology to enhance the world. There are so many problems right in front of us that demand innovation and improvement, and I firmly believe that creative solutions with technology are helping more people every day. My experience with web development has compelled me to build for the end user, with a focus on accessibility, mobility, speed, and intuitive design. I spend my time understanding the tools I practice with, remaining ever-curious about how the web is built and how it can be leveraged, using technology and data to empower myself and others to ask the right questions and make the right decisions about the world around us.\r\n\r\nI have since held jobs as a consultant and full-time front-end developer. I have helped build the backend API for a mobile application, turned UI mock-ups into fully functioning web applications, and been part of larger discussions on both product and design.","field_hired":"1","field_social_github":"https:\/\/github.com\/indiesquidge","field_social_linkedin":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/austingwood","field_social_twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/indiesquidge","term_node_tid":"Remote|San Francisco, California"},{"nid":"3671","title":"Chandra Carney","field_team_member_title":"Accessibility Developer","path":"\/alumni\/chandra-carney","field_picture":{"src":"https:\/\/www.turing.io\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/300x300\/public\/larger.jpg?itok=hlwlRdDG","alt":""},"field_user_bio":"I come from an art, marketing, communications, and accessibility background and found interest in tech when I worked for an e-commerce startup in 2013.
